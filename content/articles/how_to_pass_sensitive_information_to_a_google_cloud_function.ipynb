    "In this post we will go trough the process of creating and updating secrets via Google Secret Manager, which allows you store, manage and access text strings that should be considered secret. After we have created our secret we will have a look at how we can use Google Secret Manager to securely use our secret in a Google Cloud Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Cloud Functions makes it easy to build serverless Python programs and quite often you need to access sensitive information when working with APIs or databases. It is possible to store this information by either hard coding it in your function or storing it in an environment varable that allows plain text strings like database passwords, API keys, or TLS certificates. It is usually not recommended to do this since any third-party dependency or library you use in your function has access to these same environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we can conveniently store our secret along side our function with the help of Google Secret Manager, and access our secret at the application layer. \n",
    "This will limit access to the secret and it will only be available to those users who can access it in Secret Manager and, of course, the Google Cloud Function at runtime."

## About Hampus Sandén

My name is Hampus Sandén and i'm partner and co-founder of a digital marketing agency called 56K digital. I work as a data analyst where my main area of expertise is the Google Marketing Platform stack and Google Cloud products.

I grew up in a small town in southern Sweden called Kristianstad and have a background in digital marketing and web development. I’ve been programming actively since 2008, and I built my first website/blog that same year. Marketing, affiliate, and web analytics all fell into my sphere of interest shortly after. In recent years that interest has shifted into the Data Science field and Python is as of couple of years back now my main language of choice.

This blog is my personal notebook where i collect and share what i've learned through the years but also it is a way for me to learn what i'm currently working on and there's no better way than to try and write it down in a clear and consice manner. If you've found your way to my blog i greet you with a warm welcome and hope that some of my experience in the field can help you in your journey.

    "In this snippet we will take a list of arbitrary length and split it up into equal size chunks. It is very common that you will have to do this when working with APIs that have a maximum request size. The most elegant way to do this in python is to use a generator function that will keep slicing your list into another list of given size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function differs from a regular function, because we are using the yield keyword which enables the function to comeback where it left off when it is called again. The yield keyword will help a function to remember its state and allows the caller to pause its execution and return some value, in our case we are returning a small chunk of a list."
